# 🧠 Pattern Playbook – DSA Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Pattern Playbook**, a personal repository where I'm learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by focusing on **patterns, not problems**.

Instead of brute-forcing hundreds of random questions, this repo is organized by **common patterns** (HashMap, Sliding Window, Heap, etc.).  
For each problem, I study the **solution first**, extract the **pattern template**, note **edge cases**, and then try solving it myself.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder = **pattern category**  
- Each `.md` file = **problem notes (pattern, edge cases, template, complexity)**  
- Optional: include code files (`.py`, `.js`, etc.) next to notes  


## 📝 Problem Note Format
Each problem note uses the following template:

```
# Problem: [Problem Name]

**Pattern / Category:**  

**Why This Pattern?**  

**Mini-Template (Core Logic):**
[pseudocode]

**Edge Cases:**  

**Complexity:**  
- Time:  
- Space:  

**Similar Problems:**  

**Personal Notes:**  
```



## 🎯 Study Strategy

1. Pick a **pattern family** (e.g., HashMap, Heap).  
2. Study **solution first** → understand why that pattern works.  
3. Write notes in the Playbook template:
   - Pattern used  
   - Edge cases  
   - Time/space complexity  
   - Mini-template (pseudocode)  
4. Try solving from scratch (without looking at the code).  
5. Redo after 1–2 days (**spaced repetition**).  


## 🌟 Why This Repo?

- Helps me **recognize problem families** instead of memorizing solutions  
- Builds a **reference book** for interviews  
- Shows my **structured approach to learning**


## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add solutions in **Python & JavaScript**  
- Add **visual diagrams** for certain patterns (recursion trees, heap behavior)  
- Create a **summary cheatsheet** for each pattern
